A new more standard behaviour for accelerating and braking.Now the steering of the car is more realistic.

Some improvements in the textures and the objects drawings,also some modifications for the RoadEditor.

Shift to the 1.6.0 java version.

Now a richer environment with more objects ,also for the editor,but the quality of the drawings is low.

Corrected a serious discrepancy about differences in objects drawing between the RoadEditor and the main program.

New improvements of the editor.

Numerous modifications in the editor and in the texture usage.
Removed the use in the main program and in the RoadEditor of the NUM_OBJECTS and NUM__WORLD_IMAGES parameters.

Unified the RoadEditor (now renamed) with the one of CarDriving.The only difference is the NUM_OBJECT.
Loaded reviewed and improved version of this editor. 

Changed the sound production creating the AdvancedGameSound class,shortened the car steering radius,again a review of the editors (added the undo).Now there are also textures for the 90° curves!

Added a first primitive object detection,so you can't pass through everything;improvement in implementation of the steering speed of the car,more realistic;changed completely the engine sound mechanics.All need further revision. 
Introduced a more controlled and realistic gears management. Also available an engine sound effect and an horn sound (press "H").Still experimental,not very impressive. 
Fixed an important bug in the road editor,added the multiple selection feature. 

I remember that the program can be launched directly using the jar file (after extracting the lib folder!) and the java command (read the README.txt).
